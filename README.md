# Swinelord (development in progress)

## Summary

He (or she) who controls the bacon controls the world in SWINELORD, a tower defense and assault game where the player builds a maze and defensive towers around their cache of valuable bacon to protect it from thieving raccoons. The player must also take to the offensive by hiring raccoons and deploying them strategically in other players’ mazes to plunder their bacon. Bacon can be stolen when a raccoon unit reaches a bacon cache within another players maze and then returns to the beginning (point of ingress).

## Setting

Swinelord takes place in a land where feudal Swinelords like the player seek to grow powerful by collecting bacon. 

To achieve this goal, the Swine conscript bands of nomadic Raccoons to plunder their neighbors’ bacon-caches...for a small bacon-fee, of course. 

Now, the domineering Swine enrich themselves while the Raccoons go hungry, and there has been much talk amongst the Raccoons of rebellion against their porcine overlords.
